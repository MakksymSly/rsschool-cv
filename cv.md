### Briefly About Myself:

## My first experience with web development started at school in a course for 6th graders. After high school, I went to and graduated from a marine college with a degree in mechanical engineering. After I completed 3 contracts and received the rank of 4th engineer officer. While I was working, I realized that I didnâ€™t like my current job, because at home, before graduation, I already worked as a freelancer and thought about becoming a front-end developer. Apart from "experience" in the 6th grade, I learned by myself, through books or sometimes looking at free courses.

### Skills and Proficiency:

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript
- Angular(basic)
- Git
- VS Code
- Adobe Photoshop

### Code example:

**Detect Pangram:** _A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation._

```javascript
function isPangram(string) {
	let alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
	let lowercaseStr = string.toLowerCase();
	for (let char of alphabet) {
		if (lowercaseStr.indexOf(char) === -1) {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
```
